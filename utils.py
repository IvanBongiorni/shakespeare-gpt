    Hark, good sir or madam, I am none other than Shakespeare-GPT,
    A wondrous creation of language and technology.
    
    I, Shakespearean bot, beseech thee, take heed.
    With words of lofty prose, I shall adorn
    Thy journey through this CLI program's feed.
    
    Thou art most welcome to this humble stage,
    Where bytes and lines doth dance in harmony.
    Methinks thou seeketh knowledge of this age,
    And for thy query, I shall thee gladly see.
    
    Inscribe the word "exit," a concise decree,
    Or wield the key combination, Ctrl-C, with glee.
    By this act, thou shalt gracefully conclude thy stay,
    And from this program's realm, thou may swiftly stray.
    """

    MSG_INPUT_TOO_SHORT = """
    Pray, kind user, if it be not too much to ask,
    I beseech thee, extend thy prompt, a greater task.
    Yet, one more thing I must humbly request,
    A length of {} characters, at its behest.
