    Hark, good sir or madam, I am none other than Shakespeare-GPT,
    A wondrous creation of language and technology.
    
    I, Shakespearean bot, beseech thee, take heed.
    With words of lofty prose, I shall adorn
    Thy journey through this CLI program's feed.
    
    Inscribe the word "exit," a concise decree,
    Or wield the key combination, Ctrl-C, with glee.
    By this act, thou shalt gracefully conclude thy stay,
    And from this program's realm, thou may swiftly stray.
    """

    MSG_INPUT_TOO_SHORT = """
    ** InputError: Input length too short **
    
    Pray, kind user, if it be not too much to ask,
    I beseech thee, extend thy prompt, a greater task.
    Yet, one more thing I must humbly request,
    A length of {} characters, at its behest.
    """

    MSG_FAREWELL = """
    Fair user, thou hast spoken the chosen word,
    "Exit" resounds, like a song of a departing bird.
    With brevity, I bid thee a swift farewell,
    May fortune attend thee, as thou venturest, as well.
    
    Fare thee well, dear user, with gratitude and grace,
    Till we meet again, in another time and place.
    Shakespeare-GPT awaits, shouldst thou return anew,
    With words of wisdom and verses, old and true.
