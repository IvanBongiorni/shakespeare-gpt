# Shakespeare GPT
This is a tutorial repository to show how easy it is to build a custom GPT model using [Maximal](https://github.com/IvanBongiorni/maximal) and *TensorFlow 2.x* libraries.

#### WARNING: a GPU is strongly suggested to run this code. 

## Usage
First, you need to train a model via: `python train.py`. All hyperparameters can be tweaked in `config.py`.

Second, run: `python chat.py` to load the model and generate text via command line.
